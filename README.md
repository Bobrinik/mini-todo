# Motivation
- This is a personal project that was built as a way to practice building applications by using Html, css, js, angularjs, and Nodejs

# Requirements
## What does a typical todo application needs?
- Keep a list of tasks
- Mark tasks as complete or not

## How is this app different?
- It let's you see how you project evolved over time
- Each task can have parent tasks and they are displayed as a graph


## Challenges
- Implement graph logic

## How to run this project?

```
$ npm install
$ sudo service mongod start #it's a mongodb server
$ npm start
```

## What I learnt
- Start designing the UI first and the design your backend
- Design core functionality in the UI first and the design registration and other stuff



## TODO
[X] Move tasks list to the left
[X] Add graph to the right of the task list
[] I need to connect tasks tohether
